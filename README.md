# Finite-Automaton
This project was done for the discrete mathematics course LU2IN005 at Sorbonne Universit√©. It consists in implementing basic algorithms in python for finite automatons.
## How to use the program
To use the program, you need to write the following command in the terminal, and then a pdf file will appear in the project file:
```
python3 main.py
```
You also have all the pdf files that i have obtained by testing the program.
